                    <p style="margin-left: 20px;margin-right:20px;"> Shri Kashi Vishwanath Temple is a major sacred attraction, dedicated to Lord Shiva, the presiding deity of the city. The temple houses a Shivalinga, which is said to be one amongst the twelve Jyotirlinga, the fiery pillar of light, by which Lord Shiva beckoned his divine supremacy, broke through the earth’s crust and gleamed towards the heaven.  The present temple was built by Rani Ahailya Bai Holkar of Indore in the year 1776, however, Shri Kashi Vishwanath Temple was existent even before the present one. About 800 kg of gold being used to cap the spire by Maharaja Ranjit Singh, hence it is also known as the Golden Temple in Varanasi. 
                        <br><br>The temple has been built and re-built several times over the past centuries. The temple derives its name from Kashi, another name for Varanasi. This tirth also finds mention in old religious texts like Skanda Purana. The devotional atmosphere here is almost palpable. For the pilgrim who may have travelled thousand miles, the sanctity of the temple is only heightened by the teeming crowds, chanting of mantras and the continuous ringing of bells. Within the courtyard stands many smaller shrines, and a 2.1 metre high figure of Shiva’s bull, Nandi. The aarti held here is one of the most overwhelming experiences you can have on your trip to Varanasi.   
                        <br><br>Varanasi, one of Hinduism’s holy cities, is home to the revered Kashi Vishwanath Temple. This temple has been an integral part of practising the Shaiva philosophy for a very long time. It is famous for its gold-plated domes and spires and its Nandi Bull statue.

                        Destroyed and rebuilt a number of times, the present structure stands near the original temple site. Hindus from around the world try to visit the temple at least once in their lifetime – the belief being that the temple darshan and a dip in the Ganges will lead a devotee to Moksha.

                       <br> <br>The best time to visit Varanasi for a temple darshan is in the winter months, between October through March. The weather, though cold in December and January, suits travellers since most sightseeing is outdoors. If you are not looking to attend one of the aartis, then the best time to visit the temple is at 7 AM, to avoid long queues.It is located in the heart of the city, near the Dashashwamedha Ghat. It is situated at a distance of 5 KM from the Varanasi Station.
