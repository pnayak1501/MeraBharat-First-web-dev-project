                    <p style="margin-left: 20px;margin-right:20px;"> An incredibly breathtaking example of Indo - Saracenic style of architecture, the Mysore Palace is a magnificent edifice located in Mysore in the state of Karnataka. Also known as the Amba Vilas Palace, it is the former palace of the royal family of Mysore and is still their official residence. Mysore Palace was built in the year 1912 for the 24th Ruler of the Wodeyar Dynasty and is counted amongst one of the biggest palaces in the country.<br><br>
                        The construction of the Mysore Palace was orchestrated by the Maharaja Krishnaraja Wadiyar IV referred as "Rajarishi" (saintly king) by Mahatma Gandhi. It was then further expanded by his son and the last Maharaja of Mysore, Maharaja Jayachamaraja Wadiyar. The facade of the palace is a harmonious blend of Hindu, Muslim, Rajput and Gothic styles which imparts it a regal quality. With the Chamundi Hills towards its eastern side, the spectacle of the Mysore Palace is an enchanting sight to behold. Needless to say, it is the second most visited historical monument visited by both local and foreign tourists after the Taj Mahal. Presently located inside the Old Fort, Mysore Palace is renowned for its light & sound show and vibrant Dussehra celebrations.<br><br>
                        Vijaya Dashami is the major festival that is celebrated every year in autumn. The festival is celebrated for about ten days, and the main attraction of the festival is a parade march by the elephants. The entire area is decked up like a bride during Dussehra, and it attracts tourists all across the world. Members of the royal family, as well as special guests of honour, attend the ceremony. The royal sword or the "Pattada Katti" is taken on a procession around the city on the auspicious day of Mahanavami, the ninth day of the festival.<br><br>
                        The best time to visit the palace is around the time of Dussehra when the entire compound is beautifully decorated and lit, illuminated in a golden hue.

                        The palace is lit every Sunday and on all public holidays. Mysore Palace is located right in the heart of Mysore city. The Mufesal Bus stand is located just a couple of kilometres away from the palace. The KSRTC buses operate from this bus stand at short intervals. You can then walk from the bus stand to the north gate or the east gate of the palace. Alternatively, you can hire an auto rickshaw from the bus stand to the palace gate. If you are travelling by train to Mysore, you can hire an auto rickshaw from outside the station to reach the palace.
