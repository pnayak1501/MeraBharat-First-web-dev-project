            <h1 style="margin-left: 365px;margin-top: 20px;"> SO WHAT’S THIS SITE ALL ABOUT </h1><hr>
            <br><br></br>
            <p style="margin-left: 200px; margin-right: 200px;font-size:25;">I started Mera Bharat primarily as a travel blog for my family and friends. After saving money while working a lawyer for 5 years, I quit my job in 2008. My plan was to travel the world for a year and then return to the law. I figured it might be fun for people who knew me to come along for the ride online.<br><br>
                It has been 11 years, and I have yet to return to the practice of law. This deviation was a bit of a fortunate accident, because I never intended Legal Nomads to become my job. But as time went on, the site’s popularity grew and the projects I worked on multiplied with the new audience. What started as nomadic living has morphed into a home base in Oaxaca, Mexico, with exciting work in food and storytelling.<br><br>

             <p style="margin-left: 200px;font-size:large; margin-right: 200px;font-size:45;"> About Mera Bharat</p>
             <br><br>
             <p style="margin-left: 200px;margin-right:200px;font-size: 25;">Mera Bharat began as a vaguely chronological recounting of my time living and eating abroad. I wanted friends to follow along, and I loved to write. As a celiac who traveled, food was an important part of my days. I needed to know what to eat, and what to avoid so that I did not get sick. Through the lens of mealtimes, I was able to learn so much more about a place and its people. I also discovered a deep abiding love of soup.</p>

             <img src="rush.jpg" style="margin-left: 200px;margin-right:200px;"><br><br><br>
             <p style="margin-left: 200px;font-size:large; margin-right: 200px;font-size:45;">Legal Nomads evolved from a personal blog to a multi-focused platform for food, stories, and photography.</p><br><br>
             <p style="margin-left: 200px;margin-right:200px;font-size: 25;">  Here, readers will find a community that connects storytellers who want to dig deep into a new country, in-depth food guides to cities around the world, and a long set of resources to help plan and budget for long term travel. From my end, I want the site to remain an inspiration to those who crave a life of travel and exploration, but one that also sets realistic expectations about the sacrifices unconventional choices require.</p>  
             <br><br><p style="margin-left: 200px;font-size:large; margin-right: 200px;font-size:45;">Making Money  </p><br><br>
             <p style="margin-left: 200px;margin-right:200px;font-size: 25;">Ah the money question.
                        <br><br>
                    Understandably, people want to know how to make an unconventional job work. No, I don’t have a trust fund. No, I don’t have a rich boyfriend. Yes, these are actual questions that I’ve received.
                    <br><br>
                    My writing slowly grew from passion project to platform for a few different revenue streams, each built upon the foundation of this site. I am fortunate that this site began in 2008, before the travel blogging sphere was established and saturated. My readership grew considerably year by year, and eventually I was able to shift away from blogging and toward the projects below.
