                    <p style="margin-left: 20px;margin-right:20px;">  An identifying feature of the city, Charminar is the most prominent landmark located right in the heart of Hyderabad. The monument was erected by Quli Qutub Shah to signify the founding of Hyderabad. As is evident from the structure, it was so named as it consists of four minarets. Although it lies right in the centre of the city with traffic and crowds milling all about it, Charminar certainly manages to hold the gaze. It is also famous for the market that sprawls around it and is called 'Laad' or 'Chudi' Bazaar.<br><br>
                        Since the construction of the monument in 1591, Charminar has been synonymous with the culture of Hyderabad standing tall as a reminder of the glorious days of the past era. It is a massive structure which has four minarets which many believe stand for the first four 'khalifas' (Prophets) of Islam. Towards the north of the monument, there are four gateways known as Char Kaman which have been constructed in the cardinal directions. The structure was intended to serve as a Madrasa or a Mosque. In its present form, Charminar, along with Qutub Shahi Tombs and the Golconda Fort, has been added to the 'tentative list' of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.<br><br>
                        Charminar was built by Sultan Muhammad Quli Qutub Shah, the fifth ruler of the Qutb Shahi dynasty when he shifted his capital from Golconda to Hyderabad. According to the historians, the inadequacy of water and the plague forced Quli Qutub Shahi to move his capital. He pledged to build a monument if the suffering of his people came to an end. The Charminar was built to commemorate the decision and eradication of plague from the city. It is known as Charminar as it is supported by four minarets on four sides which were possibly meant to commemorate the first four caliphs of Islam. The old city of Hyderabad was designed keeping Charminar as the centre of the city. 

                       According to some legends, Quli Qutub Shahi saw his beloved wife, Baghmati, at this very site. He built Charminar as a symbol of his eternal love for his wife. There is also a legend that talks about the existence of a secret tunnel under the Charminar that connects it to the Golkonda Fort. It was created as a means of escape for the royal family in the time of emergencies. <br><br>
                       Charminar is located at a distance of 5 km from the Hyderabad Bus Station. APSRTC (Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation) runs regular buses from every part of the city. You can also reach Charminar by hiring an autorickshaw or a taxi from any point in the city.
