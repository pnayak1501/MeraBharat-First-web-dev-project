The spiral staircase consisting of 379 stairs takes one to the top of the monument. It also tilts a little from 65 m above the ground level. The five-storey building has been built with red sandstone and marble. Every floor has a protruding balcony surrounding the minaret and supported by corbels.

                       It is a classic example of Indo-Islamic architecture. With the difference in the architectural styles and the materials used in construction, it is apparent that the tower was constructed over the years by different rulers.

Verses from Quran can be seen engraved on the minaret with other inscriptions of Parso-Arabic and Nagari characters.<br><br>
