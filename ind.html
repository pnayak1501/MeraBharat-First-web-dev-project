                    <p style="margin-left: 20px;margin-right:20px;">India Gate that in fact lies around the ceremonial avenue of Raj path is an Important and significant Memorial Site completed in February of 1921 and forms the landmark of Delhi also known as the gate of the eight city of Delhi named 'New Delhi' which was carved out of the beautifully architected Old City of Delhi created by the Mughal Emperors in the ancient times. It lies in the heart of the new city flanked by roads on all directions and is easily accessible by local taxis, buses and auto rickshaws from any corner of Delhi due to its central location.<br><br>

                        This City of New Delhi is probably one of the well planned cities designed by Edwin Lutyens and Herbert Baker around the likes of the British rulers with India Gate and the surrounding areas of Raj path forming the main plan of central Delhi including the Rashtrapati Bhavan formerly known as the Viceroy's Palace commanding a panoramic view of the city. The view stretches from Raisina Hills running seamlessly across India Gate and Raj path but is hindered only by the National Stadium of Delhi. <br><br>
                    
                       At the centre of New Delhi stands the 42 m high India Gate, an "Arc-de-Triomphe" like archway in the middle of a crossroad. Almost similar to its French counterpart, it commemorates the 70,000 Indian soldiers who lost their lives fighting for the British Army during the World War I. The memorial bears the names of more than 13,516 British and Indian soldiers killed in the Northwestern Frontier in the Afghan war of 1919.<br><br>

                       The foundation stone of India Gate was laid by His Royal Highness, the Duke of Connaught in 1921 and it was designed by Edwin Lutyens. The monument was dedicated to the nation 10 years later by the then Viceroy, Lord Irwin. Another memorial, Amar Jawan Jyoti was added much later, after India got its independence. The eternal flame burns day and night under the arch to remind the nation of soldiers who laid down their lives in the Indo-Pakistan War of December 1971.
                       During nightfall, India Gate is dramatically floodlit while the fountains nearby make a lovely display with coloured lights. India Gate stands at one end of Rajpath, and the area surrounding it is generally referred to as 'India Gate'.Surrounding the imposing structure is a large expanse of lush green lawns, which is a popular picnic spot. One can see hoards of people moving about the brightly lit area and on the lawns on summer evenings.
