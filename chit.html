                    <p style="margin-left: 20px;margin-right:20px;"> Chittorgarh Fort is regarded as the symbol of Rajput chivalry, resistance and bravery. The fort is situated 175 kilometer to the east of Udaipur and is believed to be named after the person who built it, Chitrangada Mori. The famous Chittorgarh fort, which is one of the largest in India, is situated on a 180 meter high hill that rises from the banks of river Berach. The fort is known for its seven gates namely Padan Gate, Ganesh Gate, Hanuman Gate, Bhairon Gate, Jodla Gate, Lakshman Gate and the main gate which is named after Lord Ram. <br><br>
                        The Chittorgarh fort houses many palaces, like the Rana Kumbha Palace, the Fateh Prakash Palace, the Tower of Victory and Rani Padmini's Palace. All these structures are significant for their Rajput architectural features. There are also many temples within the fort. A huge complex of Jain temples are a major attraction. Chittorgarh fort, along with other hill forts of Rajasthan was declared as UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2013.
                        There's enough to do in the area to occupy a full day. It you want to go shopping, avoid buying anything inside Chittorgarh fort (you'll pay too much and/or get poor quality products). Instead, trawl the markets in Chittorgarh town. Popular ones are Sadar Bazaar, Rana Sanga Market, Fort Road Market, and Gandhi Chowk. You'll find an array of goods including metalwork, textiles, miniature paintings, traditional Thewa jewelry, leather shoes, puppets, and handmade toys. Akola printed fabrics, made from vegetable dyes, are a specialty of the region.<br><br>
                        Nagri, about 25 minutes northeast of Chittorgarh alongside the Bairach River, was an important ancient town known as Madhyamika. Excavations have found punch-marked coins there that are believed to date as far back as about the 6th century BC. Rajasthan's oldest Vishnu temple, from the 2nd century BC, was also uncovered at Nagri. The town flourished during the Mauyan and Gupta periods, and remained an important religious center up to the 7th century. It's in ruins now, although old coins apparently still turn up.<br><br>
                        There are more things to see in Bassi village, about 15 minutes further on from Nagri. Handicrafts such as sculptures, pottery and woodwork are a highlight. Other attractions are temples, step wells and cenotaphs.

                        If you're traveling by road from Udaipur to Chittorgarh, Sanwariyaji temple dedicated to Lord Krishna, can be visited on the highway about 50 minutes from Chittorgarh. It was recently grandly rebuilt and looks captivating.
