                    <p style="margin-left: 20px;margin-right:20px;">One of the most popular beaches in North Goa, Baga Beach is located close to Calangute beach, around 30 Km North of Panaji. It is so named after the 'Baga creek' which flows into the Arabian Sea. Baga is the perfect destination for you if you wish to witness the excellent nightlife of Goa as signature places such as Britto's, Tito's and Mambos have made their mark in their hearts of party-goers. The shacks come to life in the late evening with some pumping music and mouthwatering food. <br><br>
                        It is also famous for its designer stores as well as its street-side markets where you can shop till your feet ache and your wallet grumbles! Being one of the most visited beaches in the North, Baga also has a vast range of water sports that you can try your hands at. Grab a sumptuous breakfast at Infantaria - a highly recommended eatery, relax by the beach all day, and in the evening let the party animal in you come alive - it's all possible at Baga Beach. Baga Beach is considered to be the extension of Calangute Beach itself since both of these lies on the same stretch of the shore. <br><br>
                        Lined with an array of tattoo parlours, tarot shops, palmistry shops, spas, sun decks and some legendary shacks, it gives you a chance to live out your perfect beach holiday. If you are not a party person, you also have the option of starting your mornings with some beach Yoga, having a nutritious breakfast by the sea, and then just spend the day reading quietly on beach recliner. There is something for every kind of traveller in Baga!<br><br>
                        For the traveller looking to indulge in a wellness retreat, Baga Beach has quite a few options to explore. Begin your day with a quiet and serene morning walk along the stretch of the beach, or give your body a workout at the ABS Yoga Retreat Centre in Titos Lane 2, where you can attend yoga and meditation sessions. You can also relax and unwind at the Aroma Thai Day Spa which offers foot, head, neck, shoulder, and full-body massages, or Glamazon Salon & Spa and the Ora Regenesis Spa that offer similar facilities to all the patrons.If you are staying at Calangute, a wise decision would be to just have a calm and relaxing walk south of Calangute beach toward Baga which is only 2 km. This beach is located at a distance of16 km from Panaji, so if you wish to reach Baga all the way from Panaji, a taxi or a hired bike/ scooter is a good option.
