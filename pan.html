                    <p style="margin-left: 20px;margin-right:20px;"> The famous and sparkling blue Pangong lake is situated near Leh-Ladakh in the Himalayas, approximately at the height of 4350 meters. This endorheic lake is 12 kilometres long and extends from India to Tibet, with two-thirds of it lying in the latter. Owing to its altitude, the Pangong Lake temperature ranges from -5°C to 10°C as a result of which it freezes completely during winters in spite of its salinity. A unique feature of the lake is that it does not remain blue throughout the year or even the day, rather it changes colours from azure to light blue to green and grey too!<br><br>
                        Also known as Pangong Tso, it has been a tourist attraction for a very long time and has gained further popularity after being a 'hot-spot' for many film shoots, apart from being essential for anyone travelling to Leh - Ladakh. The sublime beauty, crystal waters and gentle hills of Pangong Lake are an exceptional example of the beautiful landscape of the region. There are two streams from the Indian side that form the wetlands and marshes at the edges. It is the beauty of the impeccable blue waters that embezzle the tourist's attention the most. The serenity and tranquillity of Pangong Lake are the tourist's paradise.<br><br>
                        The natural setting of Pangong Lake makes it a perfect destination for a quaint little camping adventure. If you wish to camp at the lake, you might want to consider tenting which is the only viable option. The tents are quite clean, cosy and comfortable with meals included in the package. In addition to the camps, you can also try out homestays here where local households provide accommodation.

                        The ideal place to live is 32 kilometre from Pangong Lake in a place called Tangste. Also, there are places to live in and around the vicinity of Lukung which is close also located close by and has the provision of eco huts. One can, however, be based at Leh, which has numerous options for accommodation and take a day trip to the lake. The beautiful setting of this destination makes it an ideal spot to relax and unwind.<br><br>
                        It is best to visit this lake in summers, precisely from June to September, as in winter, due to its extreme weather and high altitude, the vacation would not be as enjoyable and the lake would be frozen as well. A visit in summer will open an avenue to witness different migratory birds and other flora fauna.
